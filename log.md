### Day 2: Jan 06th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed a few more challenges on the "Apis and Microservice certification". Learned more about routes, and how to chain method requests using Node.Js and Express.

**Thoughts** Things are getting a little bit harder. Excited for the next challenges with MongoDB and Mongoose.

### Day 4: Jan 08th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished MongoDB and Mongoose challenges. Looking forward to the next day: Finally I'll start working on the project!

**Thoughts** I got used to read the Mongoose documentation, so I could complete the challenges way faster.

### Day 5: Jan 09th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished my first FCC API and Microservices project! "API Project: Timestamp Microservice". Learned a little bit more about handling date instances in Javascript and routing a Get request with express.

**Thoughts** I forgot to test the "empty string" parameter, and had to refac a little, ended up improving the code. Having fun!

### Day 6: Jan 10th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished my second FCC API and Microservices project! "Request Header Parser Microservice". Worked with headers in Javascript and Node.js, grabbing local Ip address, User Agent (local browser) and prefered language!

**Thoughts** Had a lot of fun working on this challenge. Learned once and for all that a Javascript client acts completely different than a Node server.

### Day 7: Jan 11th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Working on my third API and microservices project "URL Shortener Microservice". Learned about URL shorteners, more about mongoose and dns core (lookup)

**Thoughts** Having a lot of fun working on this challenge! Spent almost 3h, but I'm feeling tired and have to sleep. I'll be back tomorrow, hopefully, to finish it!

### Day 8: Jan 12th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the URL Shortener Project. Made a business decision to stop trying with dns core module and use a npm module. Learned for once and for all what a url shortener means: It means the real url is saved on a database and the counter or Id is "short url" lol

**Thoughts** Just a few minor changes missing before submitting this project. Almost there!

### Day 9: Jan 13th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked with promises to check if the Url sent by the user is valid. Changed the shortId character generaton to improve user experience when using the encoded "shortUrl". 

**Thoughts** Finally finished the url shortener project. Had a lot of fun, and worked with promises for the first time :)

### Day 10: Jan 14th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the exercise tracker API. Created 3 routes/microservices to be used on this project, and making good progress so far.

**Thoughts** : Fun project :)

### Day 11: Jan 15th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the API responsible to log user exercises. After logging the exercise, the data must be returned. Had some trouble with the correct mongoose method to make the update. I also thought that I should use a collection of exercises inside the user table, but it ain't part of the requirement.

### Day 12 & 13: Jan 16th & Jan 17th, Wednesday & Thursday - feeling sick :(

**Today's Progress**: Had to go back to the "add exercise" API to push to a collection of exercises instead of updating the current record. Also created a new attribute on the Schema: Counter. Started working on the 4th and 5th exercises: To return the exercises list. It will be hard and fun!

### Day 14: Jan 18th, Friday - Feeling better :) 

**Today's Progress**: Still getting a few bugs on the code, specially now that I set up my Postman tests properly. Working on the API to retrieve logs, using userId, from&to date ranges and limit to query.

### Day 15: Jan 19th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished some details that were missing to filter exercises by Date. Tested all my api's, and they are working as expected. Submitted my project to FCC.

### Day 16: Jan 20th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I deployed one of my favorite FCC projects so far to Heroku. My Url Shortened project can now be tested and used on https://calega-url-shortener.herokuapp.com/ . Had to make a few changes to make it possible, so I've learned more about package dependencies, environment variables in node (.env) and how to re-attempt to connect to the MongoDB if something goes wrong.
